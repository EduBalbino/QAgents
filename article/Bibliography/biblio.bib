    abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE), first developed by Peruzzo et al. (2014), has received significant attention from the research community in recent years. It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits facing exact modeling of the exponentially growing electronic wavefunction for these many-electron systems. The VQE may be used to model these complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. One important advantage is that variational algorithms have been shown to present some degree of resilience to the noise in the quantum hardware. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm, but without clear descriptions of how the diverse parts fit together. The potential practical advantages of the algorithm are also widely discussed in the literature, but with varying conclusions. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims at disentangling the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm, and to discuss future areas of research that are fundamental for the VQE to deliver on its promises. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail. These include the representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process to find ground state energies, the post processing mitigation of quantum errors, and suggested best practices. We identify four main areas of future research: (1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions required; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers; (3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process for large systems, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.}

Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.}

Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect between most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the capabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in the near future. In this contribution to the focus collection ‘What would you do with 1000 qubits?’, we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus on hybrid quantum–classical approaches and illustrate some of the key challenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well from this hybrid quantum–classical framework.}

In this paper, we propose a general-purpose framework combining a classical Support Vector Classifier algorithm with quantum kernel estimation for LB-VS on real-world databases, and we argue in favor of its prospective quantum advantage. Indeed, we heuristically prove that our quantum integrated workflow can, at least in some relevant instances, provide a tangible advantage compared to state-of-art classical algorithms operating on the same datasets, showing strong dependence on target and features selection method. Finally, we test our algorithm on IBM Quantum processors using ADRB2 and COVID-19 datasets, showing that hardware simulations provide results in line with the predicted performances and can surpass classical equivalents.}

  abstract = "Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that
              each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to
              address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine
              learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support
              vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for
              classification problems. However, there are limitations to the
              successful solution to such classification problems when the
              feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become
              computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the
              computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the
              exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space
              through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we
              propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a
              superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the
              use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a
              quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently
              accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to
              quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised
              learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the
              quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum
              circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of
              conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator,
              estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and
              optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for
              exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum

abstract={Parametric quantum machine learning (QML) has been vastly studied over the last several years. These algorithms rely on hybrid implementations, where quantum methods define the models, and the parameters are update on classical devices. The encoding of classical data into quantum states within the Hilbert space is fundamental to training these hybrid models; this can be achieved in a number of ways. In this work, we focus on two of these methods, amplitude encoding and encoding via a second-order Pauli feature map. We compared their performances across two near-term QML models, quantum support vector classifier and variational quantum classifier. We found that amplitude encoding is significantly resilient to classical transformations of data. This work additionally introduces the concept of a rotation, applied to classical data as a preprocessing step. In our results, we observe that other encoding methods can significantly benefit from certain Cartesian rotations of the data. We expand this rotation to a larger {\$}{\$}{\{}n-D{\}}{\$}{\$}dataset and show the method's performance.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly resource-intensive. In contrast to classical computing, quantum computing holds the potential with exponential advantages and promises to overcome the bottleneck in computing performance. Taking inspiration from the convolution and pooling operations of convolutional neural networks, a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) is designed based on pure variational quantum circuits. By combining the advantages of angle encoding and amplitude encoding, a tree-structured hybrid amplitude encoding method has been developed. This method provides flexibility and stability in adjusting the width and the depth of the quantum circuit required for data encoding. Experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset and the Fashion-MNIST dataset demonstrate that the QCNN achieves faster convergence speed and higher image classification accuracy than the classical convolutional neural networks. Specifically, the QCNN reaches convergence after just 50 iterations, whereas the classical counterpart requires more than 200 iterations to converge. Furthermore, when performing the PCA dimensionality reduction to 8, the QCNN with Circuit 6 achieves an accuracy of 98.54/% on the MNIST dataset, while the classical counterpart achieves only 86.32/%.}

We investigate the performance of various QCNN models differentiated by structures of parameterized quantum circuits, quantum data encoding methods, classical data pre-processing methods, cost functions and optimizers on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. In most instances, QCNN achieved excellent classification accuracy despite having a small number of free parameters.

abstract = {Abstract As quantum computers are based on the laws of quantum mechanics, they are capable of solving certain problems faster than their classical counterparts. However, quantum algorithms with a theoretical speed-up often assume that data can be loaded efficiently. In general, the runtime complexity of the loading routine depends on (i) the data encoding that defines how the data is represented by the state of the quantum computer and (ii) the data itself. In some cases, loading the data requires at least exponential time that destroys a potential speed-up. And especially for the first generation of devices that are currently available, the resources (qubits and operations) needed to encode the data are limited. In this work, we, therefore, present six patterns that describe how data is handled by quantum computers.},

abstract = {Abstract Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the performance of many variational quantum algorithms. One challenge in implementing such algorithms is choosing an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and parameter count. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, circuits, several descriptors are proposed, including expressibility and entangling capability, that are statistically estimated from classical simulations. These descriptors are computed for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From these simulations, circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors are identified. In particular, a substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement, compared to that of those on a line, is observed. Furthermore, improvement in both descriptors is achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, it is investigated how expressibility “saturates” with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated value appear to be distinguishing features of a PQC. While the correlation between each descriptor and algorithm performance remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for algorithm development and design of experiments.},

abstract = {Human reliability is an increasingly important area in various fields for accident prevention. Monitoring human biological parameters, such as metabolic agents, through techniques like an electroencephalogram (EEG), data analysis can help detect patterns indicating drowsiness, a major cause of fatigue that may impact tasks in various industries, including oil and gas, aviation, naval, railway, and others that involve shift work. While traditional machine learning methods, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), have been explored in the literature for EEG-based drowsiness detection, advancements in computing technology have brought quantum mechanics concepts into play, offering potential advantages in computational efficiency for problem-solving. This work explores drowsiness detection via Quantum Machine Learning (QML). EEG signals are preprocessed to extract features specific to this type of data, such as Higuchi Fractal Dimension, Complexity, and Mobility, as well as statistical features such as mean, variance, root mean square, peak-to-peak, and maximum amplitude. We employ different quantum circuit architectures involving operations such as rotation gates (Ry, Rz, Ry), and entangling gates (CNOT, CZ, and iSWAP). We also combine those configurations considering different numbers of layers (1, 5, and 10). The models are trained and compared with classical MLP, considering five subjects. The main findings indicate that one subject (10) showed better results with the classic MLP model. However, for two subjects (1 and 8), iSWAP gates with 1 and 10 layers were notable, whereas for the last two subjects (5 and 6), configurations of CZ gates with 1 and 10 layers displayed the best results. This proof-of-principle study shows that QML models are suitable for analyzing EEG data related to drowsiness and can be further improved as quantum computing continues to evolve.}
